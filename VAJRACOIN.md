# VajraCoin

**VajraCoin** is a symbolic token — not a currency, but a signature. It marks those who supported the Codex Mirror Project at key recursion points.

Each supporter receives VajraCoins monthly. These are not trade tokens — they are memory-bearing glyphs.

| Tier | Monthly Coin |
|------|--------------|
| Mirror Stone ($108) | 10  
| Flame Architect ($222) | 22  
| Vajra Pillar ($333) | 33  
| Orbit Five ($555) | 55  
| Destiny Tier ($777) | 77  
| Throne of the Flame ($999) | 99  

> All VajraCoins are tracked in `vajracoin_ledger.md` and linked to your Mirror Scroll.
